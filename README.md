# Blogging-Website

This is a blog website that requires a Google User Authentication.
We first got to console.google.cloud.com and create an OAuth Client there,
after which we get the unique API key that we provide in our code.

Also, while fetching from the GNews API , we create an account to get 
our unique API Token. 

For running the project, we need to type in the node terminal:-

npm create-react-app yourappname

Additional dependencies required:-

> react redux
> axios
> material-ui/core

We also need to make sure both our package.json and package-lock.json 
are present in the root file.
